## What is MegaMindz?

MegaMindz is a conceptual AI-powered mental wellness suite designed for the Microsoft Hackathon: *Harness AI to support emotional well-being*.

It’s a lightweight system that provides tools for stress relief, early emotional distress detection, and long-term mental resilience—built on Microsoft’s AI and cloud technologies.

## The MegaMindz Suite

### Mega Journals
Structured, AI-guided journaling. Users reflect on their thoughts, track emotions, and get insights or calming prompts based on the emotional tone of their entries.

### Mega Mindfulness
Personalized meditations generated with natural language inputs (e.g., “I feel anxious”) and delivered through calming speech synthesis.

### Mega Habits
A habit tracker focused on emotional well-being. Tracks routines like water intake, exercise, sleep, and digital detoxes to reinforce healthy behaviors and consistency.

## How It Works (Concept Demo)

MegaMindz meets users where they are—on their phones—and gives them tools to feel better, think clearer, and grow emotionally.

Example user journey:

1. A student overwhelmed with exams opens Mega Journals and unloads their thoughts.
2. Emotional tone detection notices high stress, and Mega Mindfulness recommends a guided breathing meditation.
3. After meditating, the user logs “10-minute breathing” in Mega Habits, maintaining their wellness streak.
4. If distress patterns repeat, the app prompts the user to repeat proven coping rituals or reach out for additional support.

## Tech Stack (Microsoft-Centered Concept)

This concept demonstrates how Microsoft’s tools can be used together to deliver real emotional support with AI at the core:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Azure OpenAI Service | Generates journaling prompts, reflection feedback, and meditation scripts |
| Azure Cognitive Services | Analyzes emotional tone of journal entries |
| Azure Cosmos DB | Stores journals, mood logs, and habit data |
| Azure Functions | Handles app logic and task flow |
| Microsoft Graph API | Syncs wellness goals with user calendars |
| Azure Notification Hubs | Sends mindfulness reminders and daily check-ins |
| Azure Speech Services | Converts meditation scripts into calming voice playback |
| Power BI | Tracks user trends and emotional progress |
| Power Automate | Converts journaling insights into personalized action plans |

Security is handled through Microsoft Entra ID and Azure Key Vault to ensure full POPIA/GDPR compliance.
